             <strong>Iâ€™m a Problem Solver.</strong> And I will not give up. This leaves me bleary eyed in front of my screen a little too often. Thankfully, I know when to pull away, go for a run and come back refreshed and eager to try a different approach. I love to build a full stack application. I love the challenge of a new framework and the excitement of seeing the magic it comes with. I also obsess over the little details of the front end, getting that heading in just the right spot or playing around with a little spring animation. My two little ones push me to keep learning<strong> and</strong> to stop everything and play hide and seek.
